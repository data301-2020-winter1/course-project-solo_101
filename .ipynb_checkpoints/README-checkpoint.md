## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For this project I will analyze details about all of the worlds glaciers, such as elevation, size, activities and many more aspects. I would like to speciffically want to determine which countries have the most receeding glaciers in the world and what percent of the worlds glaciers are melting. Another question I would like to awnser is there a relationship between factors such as elevation and what the glacier is doing. In addition to this i might look into weather the direction a glacier faces has any impact on its activity. This topic is interesting because glaciers all around the world are melting, but I dont really have a good graso on the scale and would like to get a better idea of that. Since there is so much raw data in this spreadsheet it should make creating an interesting dashboard do-able, and relatively easy.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is collected from the National Snow and Ice Data center, and it is their world glacier inventory dataset. The dataset containts information for over 130 000 glaciers and has information on a large variety of informations such as elevations and orientation. The data was collected over a large variety of time and has been updated throughout the years. The data from this set is from a combination of satalite imagery and topographical maps
